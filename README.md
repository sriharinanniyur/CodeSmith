# CodeSmith - LancerHacks 2018 winner
Craft beautiful code.

## About
Enterprise-level code requires the highest quality standard. Professional developers must write easy-to-read, clear, well-structured, safe and secure code in order to keep things running smoothly. However, the tools required to do this, such as lint, are all text-based, generating hundreds of useless errors. They work in a non-intuitive, dated fashion. There is a sore need to create a graphical, intuitive programming environment that assists the programmer in writing code with good style and solid security.

CodeSmith does all this and more. It is a graphical, easy-to-use environment that clearly indicates bugs, style issues, readability problems, and better solutions to the user. It is the hub for crafting enterprise-quality software.

## Features
CodeSmith is an integrated development environment (IDE) that finds EVERYTHING that slips past most error checkers and IDEs. The majority of software bugs come from undetected errors like this that are still technically valid code. It also indicates code style issues and provides tips on better code formatting and readability. For all of these, it provides a clear line-by-line diagnosis in a graphical environment. Undetected bugs are shown in red, and style issues are shown in blue. This is all packaged into an easy-to-use graphical environment ideal for professional programmers.

## Technologies used:
CodeSmith is written in C and C++.
GTK+ 3 (for GUI), Clang-Tidy, KWStyle libraries used.

## Dependencies
Requires GTK+ 3, KWStyle, clang-tidy, and GtkSourceView 3.
