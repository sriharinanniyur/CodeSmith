# CodeSmith
Craft beautiful code.

## About
Enterprise-level code requires the highest quality standard. Professional developers must write easy-to-read, clear, well-structured, safe and secure code in order to keep things running smoothly. However, the tools required to do this, such as lint, are all text-based, generating hundreds of useless errors. They work in a non-intuitive, dated fashion. There is a sore need to create a graphical, intuitive programming environment that assists the programmer in writing code with good style and solid security.

CodeSmith does all this and more. It is a graphical, easy-to-use environment that clearly indicates bugs, style issues, readability problems, and better solutions to the user. It is the hub for crafting enterprise-quality software.
